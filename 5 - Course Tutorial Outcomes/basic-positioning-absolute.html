  <title>CSS Positioning Exercise</title>
  <!--
    Niels: Note that the parent needs to have its position set
    , in order for the position: absolute of the red circle to work.

    static/none -> no position set
    relative -> relative to ITSELF
    absolute -> relative to its nearest parent (that has position set)
    fixed -> fixed position, that even ignores the scrollbar

    Note that setting the position: relative to a object WITHOUT
    setting top, left, right, bottom does NOTHING to the object 
    in itself. Thus can be safely set!

    Note that if the parent has no position set, it is absolute 
    to the body (i.e. top-left corner).
