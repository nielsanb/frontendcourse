Section 3:
- Tags <p> </p> and self-closing "void" tags <img />, <br />
- Specific and global attributes

Section 4:
- Absolute and relative paths
    > "./directory/map1/me.png"
    > <a href=""> <img src="" /> </a>

Section 5:
- CSS there to style, but also to seperate the clutter in the html code for organisation
- Inline: 1 element: <p style="background: blue"> </p>, normally added to a single element, but normally not recommended.
- Internal: 1 page: <style> p {background: blue} </style>, interesting to apply to one-pagers, however you'd normally have more pages, thus ...
- External: 1 website: Having your css in an external file.
