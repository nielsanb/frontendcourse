Do the installs
    > pip install flask
    > pip install flask-login
    > pip install flask-sqlalchemy

Do the boilerplate
    > Make the project structure 
    > Make the setup.py
    > pip install -e .
    > (if the interpreter of VSC is wrong -> [ctrl + shift + p] -> [python select interpreter] -> select the right interpreter )

Create the first __init__.py en main.py file
    > create an function that instanciates the flask app in the __init__.py
    > set the secret (perhaps from a configfile)
    > import and run that function in main.py, and set the __name__ == __main__: app.run

Set the blueprints in the views.py and the auth.py file
    > from flask import Blueprint
    > Blueprint makes sure that you dont have to set all routes in one file, you can spread them (such as over views.py and auth.py)
    > also do this in the auth.py file!

Register the blueprints in the __init__.py file
    > different than working without blueprints, you now need to register them
    > make sure their names are different in the seperate files
    > note that you might set an url_prefix

Set the first routes and their functions
    > '/', '/login', '/logout', '/signup'
