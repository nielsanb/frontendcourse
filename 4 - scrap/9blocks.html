<!--
Own excersize to play around with display, position and flexbox.

Tried these! What was the outcome again? Can you imagine? And what if we play around with the total width?
    body {margin: 0}

    display: block; 
    display: inline; -> without the text in the divs 
    display: inline-block;
    display: none;
 
    position: static
    position: fixed
    position: fixed; z-index: -1;
    position: relative
    position: absolute;

    display: flex/inline-flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap/nowrap;
    flex-direction: column/row/column-reverse/row-reverse;

    Wrap three boxes in another div -> what happens?

    justify-content;
    align-items;
    align-content;
    flex-flow: <direction> <wrap/nowrap>;

    align-self;
    order;

    flex-basis; Please note that this one is also set at the ITEM!
    flex-grow;
    flex-shrink;

    >> Eventually, make a javascipt page that does these things!

    body {margin: 0}
        = Removes the default white margin, and thus makes the boxes truely at left-top.

    display: block; 
        = each item on its own line/row
    display: inline; -> without the text in the divs 
        = inline elements adjust their width/heigth to the CONTENT, and thus blocks will disappear. 
        = When there is content, it will adjust to that content (i.e. only as small as the text, eventhough width and heigth are set)
    display: inline-block;
        = block makes that you can set heigth and width
        = inline makes them stick next to eachother
        > Please note that the line between the blocks is because the blocks are rendered as text, and therefore there is a space in between (as with words).
        > set font-size: 0;
    display: none;
        = Makes the element disappear
        > Also makes the rest of the elements rearrange/reorder themselves -indeed- asif the element is not there! 

    position: static
        = default
    position: fixed
        = sets position relative to viewport
        , and takes the element out of the "normal document flow" z-index=0. Thus one of the boxes moves behind.
    position: fixed; z-index: -1;
        = now the box itself is behind the others that shuffle in.
    position: relative
        = relative to its OWN regular position.
        > Thus you need to set top, bottom, left and/or right to move the box
        > If by that, there is overlap between two elements, they WILL move over eachother!
        > refer to the z-index again!
    position: absolute;
        = "absolute relative to its nearest parent that has a position relative/absolute set" / Or else to the top-left corner
        > Usefull for elements inside other elements!
        > Please note that if you do NOT set the ancestors' position, it might lead to unexpected behaviour
        > Again the element is removed from the "normal document flow".

    display: flex/inline-flex
        = set on the container. Now all previously set displays on elements inside will be ingnored! 
            > Remember that this does NOT apply for position. That does still work!
            > Note that if you'd wrap two elements in another DIV, they start acting as ONE flexbox item.
            > Note that 'flex' takes all available width, and 'inline-flex' takes only space needed, thus things can go next to it!


    gap/row-gap/column-gap: 10px
        :
            > Note that you can give individual items still a margin-top/margin-bottom,
                > That creates more space, and is on top of gap!

    flex-wrap: nowrap/wrap;
        > Remeber that flexbox is primarily good at 1D challenges (e.g. nowrap).

    flex-direction: column;

            > Can be useful to create web layout.
